Just wanted to try out whether it would be possible to test Javascript code using Spock and Mozilla Rhino. 

Have a look at the test cases for some examples. 

This was just a random experiment so I'm not very likely to continue working on this project. 
Just wanted to get the code out there in case anyone else wanted to go down the same path.
